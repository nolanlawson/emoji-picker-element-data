emoji-picker-element-data
======

Uses [emojibase-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emojibase-data) to build JSON files designed for [emoji-picker-element](https://npmjs.com/package/emoji-picker-element).

The goal is to stitch together shortcode files and general emoji data files into a single file format. Incidentally,
this provides a file format more like `emojibase-data` v5 than v6, when the shortcode and non-shortcode data were split
into separate files.

To browse the files, [use unpkg](https://unpkg.com/emoji-picker-element-data/).
